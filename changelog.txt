History & Changelog
===================

Version 3.0
 - added:    dbshell integration for parsing contacts and other info from symbian databases
 - added:    preferences allowing selection of message sources (VMG, predefmessages,
             symbian message storage)
 - improved: advanced options for installer
 - fixed:    parsing robustness fixes

Version 2.6
 - added:    extract files by drag & drop (for example on desktop)
 - added:    applying found phonebook entries on messages found in nbf backups
 - added:    extracted *.mms files can be opened individually
 - fixed:    fixes in mms parsing
 - added:    first version distibuted with installer (later)

Version 2.5
 - added:    new folder structure type (using zip compression) parsing,
             this structure can be found in backups from new models
 - fixed:    time of sent messages from "predefmessages" storage

Version 2.4
 - added:    new backup format (nbf) support. Actually nbf is nothing more than
             plain zip archive, so as a side effect, support for zip files has
             been added too. You can use NbuExplorer as "unzip with preview"
             tool now if you like
 - added:    new message format decoding (storage which is typically under
             "predefmessages" system folder). This format decoding is used
             for preview purposes but also for load of Messages tab content
             during nbf backup format parsing
 - added:    author email link added to About application dialog

             now

Version 1.14
 - added:    experimental *.arc backup format (phone side created) support,
             only first part (proably with user data) decoded (10-30% file
             coverage with available samples achieved)

Version 1.13

 - no functional change, only some internal code refactoring before publication
   of source code, because this is first version with full public access to the
   source code via SVN repository at sourceforge
 - readme.txt with short description, license.txt with GNU GPL license v3
   and this changelog.txt added to official distribution

             ordered to final file structure, but closer...)

Version 1.11

 - changed:  project name changed from "Nokia NbuExplorer" just to "NbuExplorer"
 - improved: mono compatibility (conditional usage of function that prevented
             application to run under mono on linux), tested on Ubuntu 9.10
             after installing winforms2.0 extension (can be done with command
             "sudo apt-get install libmono-winforms2.0-cil"). Thanks to
             Ricardo Pereira

Version 1.9

 - added:    "bruteforce scan" mode (available as filter in file open dialog)
             this mode will not find more files and works slower, but can help
             to recover contacts, messages, calendar and bookmarks when classic
             parsing method fails, it could also work with damaged backup files
             or different types of files containing phone data in form of vcards
             (for example communication center cache files such as
             PCCSContact.db, PCCSSMS.db etc.)

Version 1.8

 - added:    mms header and content parsing

             recognized in backups from symbian phones)
 - added:    contact and groups multimedia files extraction (images, ringtones)
 - added:    drag drop of backup files onto main form is now supported
